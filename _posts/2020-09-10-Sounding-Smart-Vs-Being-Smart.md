After meeting a large amount of people from different domains and walks of life over the last few years a pattern has started to surface to me of people who 'sound smart' vs. people who are '*actually smart*.' So thought I'd try to identify the subtle signals so that I can better recognize them going forward:

**People Who Like to Sound Smart**
* Tend to be quick to offer strong opinions
* Cite a single reference and orient their entire argument around that piece as a source of truth
* Struggle to hold competing ideas simultaneously
* Hold theory with more weight than reality
* Talk at you not with you
* Generally find them to be overconfident
* Often talk fast

**People Who Are Smart**
* Able to hold competing view points in their heads
* Show more inquiry and less certainty
* Treat things as more experimental than certain
* Doubt themselves and the past as a prediction of future results
* Generally find them to be more empathetic
* Often talk slower

Of course, there are many exceptions to this heuristic (if you can even call it that) - its most likely more of a continuum between two camps more than anything. One 'camp' more focused on external signals and the other 'camp' is more focused on internal, seem to be playing completely different games.
