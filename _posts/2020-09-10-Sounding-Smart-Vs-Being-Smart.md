A trend that's started to surface to me over the last several years of meeting large amount of people is what I like to call people who 'like to sound smart versus those who are smart'. Itâ€™s struck me as important to identify the subtle signals so that I can better recognize them going forward:

**People Who Like to Sound Smart**
* tend to be quick to offer strong opinions
* cite a single reference and orient their entire argument around that piece as a source of truth
* hold theory with more weight than reality
* talk at you not with you
* generally find them to be overconfident
* talk fast

**People Who Are Smart**
* talk slower
* able to hold competing view points in their heads
* show more inquiry and less certainty
* treat things as more experimental than certain
* doubt themselves and the past as a prediction of future results
* generally find them to be empathetic

Of course, there are exceptions to this rule - its most likely more of a continuum between two camps more than anything. It seems to me that the two different groups are actually playing different games - one is more focused on external signals and one is more focused on internal.

When possible, I'd prefer to play
