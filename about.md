My name is Matt Berg, I'm a co-founder of [Somni](http://puresomni.com/).

Somni makes products that improve health through better sleep. I work across our team to help design, build, and deploy products and services aimed at improving health and longevity through better sleep.

When I'm not working you can probably find me trying to understand the world better reading something new, working on my scratch cooking, exploring an ocean or running somewhere on a trail.

I use this site to keep book notes and writings that catch my attention. I do a poor job of updating it regularly, though if there is something of interest to you I hope you find it useful.
